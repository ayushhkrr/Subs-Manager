# Subscription Tracker API

A robust RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to manage user accounts and their recurring subscriptions. This project features secure authentication using JWT, password hashing with bcrypt, and a full suite of protected CRUD operations.

## Features

- **Secure User Authentication**: Full register and login functionality using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt` before being stored.
- **Protected Routes**: Custom middleware ensures that sensitive endpoints can only be accessed by authenticated users.
- **Full CRUD for Subscriptions**: Complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing user subscriptions.
- **Authorization**: Secure logic ensures that users can only view, update, or delete their own subscriptions.
- **Data Integrity**: Implemented a cascading delete, where deleting a user also removes all of their associated subscriptions from the database.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Token (jsonwebtoken), bcrypt
- **Middleware**: CORS, Custom Auth Middleware
- **Environment Variables**: dotenv
